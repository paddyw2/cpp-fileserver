Basic protocol:

When a client connects, the server must wait for message.

This message is of the form:

----> CIPHER, NONCE

When the server receives this message, it generates a random number and sends it to the client:

<---- RAND_NUM

The client then concatentates their plaintext password and the number, and SHA256 it, return value:

----> SHA256(pword+rand)

The server then computes the same to see if it matches. If not, terminate. Else encrypt success message with cipher and send back to client

<---- ENCRYPT(success!)
